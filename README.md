# MEDSURPLUS
### Sell leftover medicines


- An inventive proposal to combat medical waste by creating an application facilitating the resale of unused medications to local pharmacies. This innovative concept not only promotes sustainable disposal but also ensures valuable medications find a second use.
  
- Transforming surplus medicines into incentives, our app empowers users to sell to pharmacies, promoting responsible disposal. By rewarding contributions, we create a symbiotic relationship benefitting both users and pharmacies
